# wf-cms-test
## Explanation
This is a test project I made for insight into how exporting webflow code works. It's in the GV sites folder, called CMS/NO-CMS
I made 4 pages:
  - A homepage with CMS functionality
  - A copy of that homepage, remade without CMS
  - A product template page
  - A copy of that template page with no CMS
  
There's one collection in the project called 'Products' that I used top populate the CMS collection list.
There are your standard data links, a heading linked to 'Name', a paragraph linked to 'Price', an image linked to 'Image'
There are also HTML embed elements that include CMS data, based on [this](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/use-collection-fields-in-custom-code-embeds).

I exported the code, it's in the folder called `gv-cms-test.webflow`.

I also duplicated the project, ran the Udesly extension on it, and exported the code; that's in the folder called ` gv-udesly-test.webflow`.
